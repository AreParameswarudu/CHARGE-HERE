        <h3 class="headline">EV CHARGER</h3>
        <p class="para1"> An electric vehicle (EV) charging station, also known as an EV charger or electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), is a
          device that provides electric power to recharge the battery of an electric car or other plug-in electric vehicles. EV
          charging stations are becoming increasingly common as more people adopt electric vehicles.
          There are several types of EV charging stations, ranging from simple household outlets to high-powered commercial
          charging stations that can fully charge an electric vehicle in just a few hours. The most common types of EV charging
          stations include:</p>
      <p class="para2">    1.Level 1 Charging Station: 
                    This is the slowest type of charging station, providing 120 volts of alternating current (AC)power. 
                    It typically takes around 8-12 hours to fully charge an electric vehicle with a Level 1 charging station.</p>
      <p class="para2">    2.Level 2 Charging Station: 
                    This type of charging station provides 240 volts of AC power and is much faster than a Level1 station. 
                    A Level 2 charging station can fully charge an electric vehicle in 4-8 hours, depending on the size of the
                    battery.</p>   
      <p class="para2">    3.DC Fast Charging Station: 
                    This is the fastest type of EV charging station, providing direct current (DC) power to the vehicle's battery.
                    DC fast charging stations can fully charge an electric vehicle in just 30 minutes to an hour.</p>    
          
      <p class="para1"> EV charging stations can be found in many locations, including homes, workplaces, shopping centers, and along
          highways. Some charging stations are free, while others require payment, either through a subscription service or a pay-per-use system.
          As more electric vehicles hit the road, the demand for EV charging stations is expected to continue to grow, making EV
          charging station installation a promising business opportunity.</p>
